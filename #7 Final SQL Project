#4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT employeeid, firstname, lastname, title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry FROM chinook.invoices;

#6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.LastName, e.Firstname, i.InvoiceId

#8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)

SELECT SUM(total)

#10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, ii.invoicelineid

#14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
